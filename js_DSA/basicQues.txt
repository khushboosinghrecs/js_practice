What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for web development.
What are the different data types in JavaScript?

Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
Reference types: Object, Array, Function.
How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?

Using var, let, or const followed by the variable name.
What's the difference between let, const, and var?

let and const have block scope, while var has function scope.
const is for constants and cannot be reassigned.
How do you check if a variable is an array in JavaScript?

Using Array.isArray(variable).
Explain what 'hoisting' in JavaScript means.

Hoisting is the JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.
What is a closure in JavaScript?

A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its containing function, even after that function has finished executing.
What is the difference between null and undefined?

null is an intentional absence of any object value.
undefined represents an uninitialized variable or missing property.
Explain the event delegation in JavaScript.

Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor rather than individual elements. This is efficient for dynamically created elements.
How do you create a class in JavaScript?

Using the class keyword introduced in ES6.
What is a promise in JavaScript?

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations.
Explain the concept of callback functions.

Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed later when an operation is complete.
What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?

this refers to the context in which a function is executed. It can change based on how the function is called.
What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

== checks for equality with type coercion.
=== checks for strict equality, including data type.
What is the use of the map function in JavaScript?

map is used to apply a function to each element of an array and create a new array with the results.
Explain the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage.

localStorage stores data with no expiration date.
sessionStorage stores data only for the duration of a page session.
How can you create an object in JavaScript?

Using object literals, constructors, or the class syntax.
What is the purpose of the bind method?

The bind method is used to create a new function with a fixed this value and optionally some pre-defined arguments.
Explain the purpose of the reduce function in JavaScript.

reduce is used to accumulate a single value by iterating through an array.
What is a callback hell, and how can it be avoided?
Callback hell refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks make code hard to read and maintain.
It can be avoided using techniques like Promises, async/await, or libraries like async.js.
What are arrow functions in JavaScript?

Arrow functions are a shorter way to write function expressions, with a lexically scoped this.
How can you remove an item from an array in JavaScript?

Using splice, pop, or shift, or using array methods like filter.
Explain the event loop in JavaScript.

The event loop is a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. It allows JavaScript to execute non-blocking code.
What is the purpose of the try...catch statement in JavaScript?

try...catch is used to handle errors in code. Code inside try is executed, and if an error occurs, it's caught and handled in the catch block.
How can you reverse a string in JavaScript?

Using split, reverse, and join methods or by iterating through the string.
Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

JavaScript uses a prototype chain to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
What is the purpose of the typeof operator?

typeof is used to determine the data type of a variable.
How can you merge two objects in JavaScript?

Using the Object.assign() method or the spread operator ({ ...obj1, ...obj2 }).
Explain the concept of event bubbling in the context of JavaScript.

Event bubbling is a mechanism where an event triggered on a child element propagates up to its ancestors.
How do you check if a string contains a specific substring in JavaScript?

Using the includes() method or indexOf().
What is the purpose of the fetch API in JavaScript?

The fetch API is used for making network requests and is commonly used to fetch data from a server.
How can you create a copy of an object in JavaScript?

Using the Object.assign() method, the spread operator ({ ...original }), or a library like Lodash.
What is the purpose of the localStorage object in web development?

localStorage is used to store key-value pairs in the client's browser with no expiration date.
How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?

Using callbacks, promises, async/await, or event listeners.
Explain the difference between null and undefined.

null represents an intentional absence of any object value.
undefined represents an uninitialized variable or missing property.
How do you convert a string to an integer in JavaScript?

Using parseInt() or the unary + operator.
What is a callback function in JavaScript?

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later.
How can you convert a JavaScript object to JSON and vice versa?

Use JSON.stringify() to convert an object to JSON and JSON.parse() to convert JSON to an object.
Explain event delegation in JavaScript.

Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor to handle events for multiple elements.
What is a closure in JavaScript, and how do you create one?

A closure is a function that retains access to its outer (enclosing) function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.
You can create a closure by defining a function inside another function.
What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

null is an explicitly assigned value representing the absence of any object value.
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
How do you create a JavaScript class?

Using the class keyword introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).
What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?

this refers to the current object, and its value can change depending on the context in which it's used.
Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.

== checks for equality with type coercion.
=== checks for strict equality without type coercion.
What is the purpose of the map function in JavaScript?

map is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
Explain the purpose of the reduce function in JavaScript.

reduce is used to accumulate a single value by iteratively applying a function to elements of an array.
What is a promise in JavaScript?

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
How do you create an object in JavaScript?

Objects can be created using object literals, constructors, or classes.
What is event delegation in JavaScript, and why is it useful?

Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a common ancestor of multiple elements, allowing you to handle events more efficiently, especially for dynamically generated elements.
How can you remove duplicates from an array in JavaScript?

You can remove duplicates using techniques like Set, filter, or iterating over the array and creating a new array with unique values.
These questions cover a wide range of JavaScript topics that you might encounter in interviews. Practice these, and you'll be better prepared for JavaScript-related interviews.
