The HTTP status code 101 Switching Protocols is an informational response code indicating that the server has accepted the request and is changing the protocol. This status is typically used during the WebSocket handshake process.

Here's a brief explanation of the scenario:

1. **WebSocket Handshake:**
   - The most common use case for the 101 status code is during the initiation of a WebSocket connection.
   - When a client wants to establish a WebSocket connection with a server, it sends an initial HTTP request with an "Upgrade" header, indicating the desire to switch to the WebSocket protocol.

2. **Request Header Example:**
   ```http
   GET /websocket-endpoint HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Upgrade: websocket
   Connection: Upgrade
   Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
   Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
   ```

3. **Server Response (101 Switching Protocols):**
   - If the server supports WebSocket and agrees to switch protocols, it responds with the 101 status code, indicating a successful upgrade.
   - The server also includes the "Upgrade" and "Connection" headers to confirm the protocol switch.

4. **Server Response Example:**
   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
   Upgrade: websocket
   Connection: Upgrade
   Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
   ```

5. **WebSocket Communication:**
   - Once the connection is successfully upgraded, both the client and server can communicate using the WebSocket protocol.

In summary, the 101 Switching Protocols status code is an acknowledgment from the server that it has accepted the request to switch protocols, and the communication can continue using the agreed-upon protocol, such as WebSocket.
