HTTP error codes (or status codes) are three-digit numbers that are returned by web servers to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. 

Here are some of the most important HTTP error codes along with their detailed explanations:

# 1xx: Informational

### 100 Continue: 
- This means that the server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.

### 101 Switching Protocols: 
- The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will switch.

# 2xx: Successful

### 200 OK: 
- The request was successful. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request.

### 201 Created: 
- The request was successful, and a resource was created.

### 204 No Content: 
- The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated metadata.

# 3xx: Redirection

### 300 Multiple Choices: 
- There are multiple options that the client may follow.

### 301 Moved Permanently: 
- The URL of the requested resource has changed permanently.

### 302 Found: 
- The URL of the requested resource has changed temporarily. New changes in the URI might be made in the future.

### 304 Not Modified: 
- There was no new data to return.

# 4xx: Client Errors

### 400 Bad Request: 
- The request cannot be processed because of bad request syntax, excessive size, or another client error.

### 401 Unauthorized: 
- The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.

### 403 Forbidden: 
- The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource.

### 404 Not Found: 
- The server cannot find the requested resource.

### 405 Method Not Allowed: 
- The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.

### 429 Too Many Requests: 
- The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").

# 5xx: Server Errors

### 500 Internal Server Error: 
- The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

### 501 Not Implemented: 
- The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.

### 502 Bad Gateway: 
- The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.

### 503 Service Unavailable: 
- The server cannot handle the request (due to a temporary overloading or maintenance). It implies that the server will be available later.

### 504 Gateway Timeout: 
- The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or some other auxiliary server.
